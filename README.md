This model has been trained to predict the best suitable crop that can be grown based on the following attributes.
- Nitrogen Level
- Phosphorus Level
- Potassium Level
- Temperature
- Rainfall
- pH
- Humidity

GridSearchCV has been implemented to determine the best possible model with highest accuracy.
